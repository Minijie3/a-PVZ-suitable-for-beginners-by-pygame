# a-PVZ-suitable-for-beginners-by-pygame

    这是一个简单到不能再简单的基于pygame制作的植物大战僵尸（甚至不能叫作开发）。
    这是我的第一个“小玩具”，框架性的东西是随博主 @英雄哪里出来 所学，在此基础上添加了许多的小细节，同时对一些（事实上我改了不少）我认为“不太好”或难以修改的逻辑进行了一定的优化改良，同时所有的pic均来自于这位博主（我没有找到他的GitHub账号，你可以在抖音上找到它）。
    非常感谢 @英雄哪里出来 的课程，虽然我只学习了百分之四五十，每个视频只看前两分钟就开始自己写，但这确实帮助我建立了框架意识，作为一个小白，这促进了我个人巨大的进步。
需要反复声明的是，这个小玩具本身也是给小白提供的（如果你觉得自己是大佬，当作看个笑话就好），帮助小白建立起最初步的面向对象编程以及项目框架认知。另外，@英雄哪里出来 的源课程是需要收费的，我这个项目也只提供给我私人的有需要的朋友看，观者请勿传播！

    This is a plant vs. zombie game based game that is so simple that it cannot be called development.
    This is my first "little toy". The framework is learned from the blogger @英雄哪里出来. On this basis, many small details have been added. At the same time, some (in fact, I have changed a lot) logics that I think are "not very good" or difficult to modify have been optimized. At the same time, all pics come from   this blogger (I haven't found his GitHub account, you can find it on Tiktok).
    Thank you very much for the course provided by @英雄哪里出来. Although I only learned 40-50% and started writing my own videos in the first two minutes, it did help me establish a framework awareness. As a novice, this has promoted my personal tremendous progress.
It should be repeatedly stated that this little toy itself is also provided for beginners (if you think you are a big shot, just treat it as a joke), helping beginners establish the most basic understanding of object-oriented programming and project frameworks. In addition, the source courses from @英雄哪里出来 are chargeable, and this project is only available to my personal friends in need. Viewers are advised not to spread it!
